This is the Binary Black Hole Signal with LIGO event data releases from the LIGO Open Science Center (LOSC). LIGO data are acquired at 16384 Hz (2^14 Hz). Here, we have been working with data downsampled to 4096 Hz, to minimize computing/processing power. The Amplitude Spectral Density (ASD) and Binary Neutron Star (BNS) detection range. In the spectrograms plotted, there's a lot of excess power below ~20 Hz, as well as strong spectral lines at 500, 1000, 1500 Hz (also evident in the ASDs above).
